**Exercise 1**

* Create a for loop which will print your name 50 times on the screen. Do the same with while and do while loop. 

**Exercise 2**

* Define a numeric array with 10 elements. Use a foreach loop to output the value of every array's element.

**Exercise 3**

* Create a function that will have a parameter. The argument given to that parameter should be an array. The function should return the highest value from the a rray.
* Try to create an array with at least 10 numbers created randomly. You may want to take a look at the rand() function from PHP.

**Exercise 4**

* Create a PHP program that iterates the integers from 1 to 100. For multiples of three print "Back-End" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Front-End". For numbers that are multiples of both three and five print "Full-Stack".
e.g.

Back-End

Front-End
Back-End

Back-End
Front-End
